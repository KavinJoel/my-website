<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Kavin Joel Theodre A, a passionate learner and emerging tech enthusiast who believes in combining curiosity with consistency. With a background in mechanical engineering, I’ve always had a natural inclination toward how systems work—both physical and digital. This curiosity eventually guided me into the world of software development, where I’ve been building skills in Python, JavaScript, and machine learning, always eager to transform ideas into practical solutions..</p>

<p>Currently, I’m exploring projects that merge logic, creativity, and real-world impact—from 2D games to AI-powered tools. I’m deeply interested in the intersection of technology and problem-solving, and I love working on things that challenge my mind while giving me room to grow. I thrive in environments where collaboration, innovation, and continuous learning are part of the journey.</p>

<p>Beyond tech, I value discipline, respect, and self-mastery. Whether it’s learning new skills, finishing a tough project, or helping others grow—I’m all in. My goal is to build things that matter and inspire others to chase their potential, just like I do every single day.</p>
